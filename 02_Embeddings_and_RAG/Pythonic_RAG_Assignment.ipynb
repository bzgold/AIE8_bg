    "1. Yes, the text-embedding-3-small is one of the newer models that have a parameter to control the overall size. By default the length of the embedding vector is 1536, but it can be reduced without losing its concept-representing properties through the dimensions parameter. \n",
    "2. OpenAI uses text embeddings to represent the semantic meaning of text strings as vectors of floating-point numbers, where the distance between vectors reflects relatedness (shorter distance = more related, bigger distance = less related). Embeddings are commonly used for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, diversity measurement, and classification. Larger embeddings generally consume more compute, memory, and storage, while smaller embeddings are more efficient. The dimensions parameter allows developers to trade off between embedding size, performance, and cost, shortening embeddings without losing their core semantic properties.\n"

Sync runs each embedding one after another, while async allows multiple embeddings to be requested at the same time, collecting results as they finish. Async is faster for large datasets, reduces overall runtime, uses resources more efficiently, and can lower costs. It also improves scalability and is especially helpful for real-time applications, like search or recommendations, or when multiple users are making requests at the same time. "

    "\n",
    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

    "The content generated from a model is non-deterministic, but there are techniques to achieve more consistent results. Pinning your production application to specific model snapshots helps ensure stable behavior over time. You can also build evaluations that measure the behavior of your prompts so you can monitor performance as you iterate or when you upgrade models. Additionally, you can give the model high-level instructions through the API (such as tone, goals, or examples of correct responses). These developer messages take priority over user input and help enforce consistency. Another technique is to use reusable prompts defined in the dashboard rather than hardcoding them, which allows you to improve and deploy updated prompts without changing your integration code.\n"

This happens because the CEO has a hard time letting go of the function that brought them success and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area. The example given is Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, who had previously been a brilliant TV network executive. When he bought ABC, the network dropped to fourth place, but Eisner claimed that if he had extra time, he could have turned ABC around himself.

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "To have the LLM create more thoughtful and detailed responses, there are several prompting strategies that can help (based on reasoning-based prompting to encourage the model to “think” more deeply).First, chain-of-thought prompting, where you ask the model to think step-by-step or explain its reasoning before answering. Another option is deliberation prompting, which encourages the model to spend more time reasoning and produce deeper, more structured outputs. This is also where you can change the reasoning parameter to control how much computational effort the model puts into reasoning.Instructional scaffolding helps break the request into stages (for example: first list these factors, then analyze the list, then conclude with recommendations). Role prompting can change the level of depth and framing by asking the model to answer as an expert, researcher, or advisor. Lastly, self-critique (reflection) asks the model to give an answer and then review it for weaknesses and ways to improve.\n"
